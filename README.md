Some Assumptions that were made:
This is a  application which generates a grade between A to F and show it on the right hand side of  on every amazon product page.

This test project emulates how the actual fakespot extension work . So when asked to this:"	The grade should appear in the top right of the window and stay there even as your scroll down." I assumed that you meant that the grade wont go away while scorlling but  it wont attach itself to the window.Please let me know if my assumption is wrong . I will correct my code.

#Additional notes: Even though original fakespot is a page action chrome extension I didnt create a page action chrome extension(e.g event pages and stuff) as it seemed unnecessary for this exercise. Correct me if I am wrong.
